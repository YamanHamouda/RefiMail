Your so-called "computer" is a complete disappointment. I purchased this device with high expectations, and now it has completely stopped functioning. This is absolutely unacceptable. I demand an immediate refund for this defective piece of equipment. Your company needs to take responsibility for selling a product that fails so quickly. I expect a prompt resolution to this matter, or I will be forced to escalate this complaint through every available channel. Respond immediately with details of my refund.
